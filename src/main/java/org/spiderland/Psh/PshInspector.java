/**
 * PshInspector pshFile
 *
 * PshInspector can be used to inspect the execution of a Psh program.
 * After every step of the program, the stacks of the interpreter
 * are displayed. The Psh program is given to PshInspector through
 * the file pshFile. pshFile is an input file containing the
 * following, separated by new lines:
 *
 * - Program: The psh program to run
 * - ExecutionLimit: Maximum execution steps
 * - Input(optional): Any inputs to be pushed before execution,
 * separated by spaces. Note: Only int, float, and
 * boolean inputs are accepted.
